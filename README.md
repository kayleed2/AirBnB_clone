# AirBnB_clone Project
This goal of this project is to create a clone of the AirBnB web application. The finished application will consist of: 

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
